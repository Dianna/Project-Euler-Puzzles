/* Smallest Multiple:
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20? 
This function is super processor intensive, fyi (sure that's obvious though) */
